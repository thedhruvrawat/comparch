### Lab Exercise

- Design the ALU for MIPS ISA, such that it will implement the
following instructions.
```
    1. and $s1, $s2, $s3
    2. or $s1, $s2, $s3
    3. add $s1, $s2, $s3
    4. sub $s1, $s2, $s3
```

- Design the 32-bit wide AND and OR gates.

- Integrate the above modules to make the final ALU.
